*Beyond making robots work and achieve human-like dexterity, we believe there needs to be an effective authoring tool to design and prototype these interactions and experiences.*

Such a tool could also serve as a [digital twin](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-a-digital-twin/), allowing us to quickly prototype interactions and transfer them directly to the humanoid.

There exists a plathora of industrial path planning softwares, some for specific brands for their robots and others are brand agnostic

Several companies are developing simulation software, including a promising collaboration between Siemens and Unity (Game Engine). Nvidia has also created their own simulation environment.

However, we rarely see a comprehensive authoring tool in the wild that allows designers, animators, and engineers to collaboratively create, test, visualize, and export humanoid behaviors and characteristics.
