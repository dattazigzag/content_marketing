We had our prejudices, so naturally we asked: Why humanoids though? Not that humanoids were not popping up left and right but after a lot of digging and back and forth, we realized that leading tech giants and venture funds are betting big on key humanoid startups. We understood early that probably the robotics industry is here to stay and grow.

1. It is one of the natural next steps to drive innovation and to create new application levels, combining all individual technological pillars, we have seen so far - as robotics combines everything.
2. But to do so, it requires investment. Thus the companies need to show they can scale up and have a clear purpose to attract major backers.
3. And so, finally, humanoids are gaining traction because they fit right into our existing world - from offices to factories - with minimal changes needed. Or at least, that’s the assumption we’re making for now.

For a moment, we thought: Isn't this the same as autonomous driving? We tried to solve the mixed-traffic problem, making them fit into our world - yet here we are, still struggling.

We see humanoids as the physical manifestation of AI—or as the term was coined, "embodied AI". The challenges are vast but the opportunities and new use cases are also enormous.

## Challenge accepted

What an incredible chance we had to help shape how humans will interact with humanoid robots! Our whole team was buzzing with enthusiasm as we jumped into this exciting journey.

### Our Research and Our Insights - The Early Days

We explored interaction expectations, use-case scenarios, and took into account academic perspectives to inform our design decisions. By analyzing industry's focus areas and identifying gaps in user experience within the humanoid context, we established some foundations for meaningful human-robot interactions and future steps.

What we found out:

1. While companies showcase impressive technical specifications (staged demos, walking speed, operating time, maximum lifting weight), the industry is still exploring real-world applications and market fit for these emerging robot categories.
2. The integration challenge remains: how humanoid robots will seamlessly fit into our society and which use cases will provide meaningful value are questions the industry continues to address.
3. Progress on complex robotics capabilities varies across companies, particularly in human-like dexterity. Most are building core functionalities before expanding to advanced features.
4. The design spectrum ranges from highly anthropomorphic robots to task-optimized machines, with each approach finding its place depending on specific applications.
5. The conversation around workforce evolution, ethical frameworks, and data governance is evolving alongside the technology, though comprehensive guidelines for human-robot interaction are still developing.

## Perception and Acceptance: A Natural Focus for Emerging Technology

The perception of humanoids is a complex issue centered on two key areas: their potential impact on industrial job displacement and their physical appearance. 

The latter creates an inherent tension between human and non-human qualities. As academia continues to focus on traditional discussions like the uncanny valley phenomenon, it often overlooks the practical implications of these technologies. 
This phenomenon means the creepy feeling people get when something looks almost human but not quite right. 

> The term, introduced by the Japanese researcher Masahiro Mori in 1970, describes how near-human robots or computer-generated characters can cause discomfort due to their imperfections. 

However, as Siniz Kim, Partner and Founder at zigzag, points out

> _It’s time to get away from a one-dimensional understanding of __uncanny valley__. Key considerations include safety, multi-modality, role adaptability, and intelligence._ These factors highlight the broader challenges and opportunities that come with humanoid robots.

The uncanny valley goes beyond just reactions to human-like appearance - it involves behavior, context, and emotional factors working together. Rather than responding to isolated features, people react to the complete experience. Building familiarity over time helps overcome initial discomfort.

> *Although many affordances depend on the humanoid's specific role, we ultimately developed key design principles for humanoid interactions, role agnostic:*

1. Human acceptance is paramount
2. Actions should be transparent & traceable
3. Behavior should be predictable & consistent
4. Interactions should be elegantly personalized
5. Ethical integrity should be at the very core
6. Privacy should be respected and safeguarded

Our Principles has helped us with decision-making by aiding to align across multiple disciplines and stakeholders involved and acted as a barometer, enabling scalability, and preserving insights that would future-proof the efforts.

During tenuous hours and weeks for concept development and prototyping human robot interactions (to some what influence our design decisions), we concluded that there are so many interesting design challenges that need to be solved but acting on these individual challenges need some thinking and isolating them is hard.

One recurring observation is that many elements come into play: sound effects, motion, size, shapes, lights, and new smart materials—all orchestrated by intelligence.

*Beyond making robots work and achieve human-like dexterity, we believe there need to be effective ways to understand and design these interactions and experiences in the real world and beyond academia.*
